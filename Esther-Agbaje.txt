Practicing GIT
This is my class practice for learning git
I hope I get really great at it
Can't wait to start working seamlessly in git!

On Monday, the topic was User Interface 1. It was a great lesson
I was able to do the class project and also a stretch project

On Tuesday, the topic was User Interface 2. I learnt how to use inline blocks to layout a page. It was initially challenging but I eventually did a great work.

On Wednesday, the topic was User Interface 3. Learnt about flex! Flex is really awesome and makes coding so much fun and way easier! I completed my projects.
