Practicing GIT
This is my class practice for learning git
I hope I get really great at it
Can't wait to start working seamlessly in git!

On Monday, the topic was User Interface 1. It was a great lesson
I was able to do the class project and also a stretch project

On Tuesday, the topic was User Interface 2. I learnt how to use inline blocks to layout a page. It was initially challenging but I eventually did a great work.

On Wednesday, the topic was User Interface 3. Learnt about flex! Flex is really awesome and makes coding so much fun and way easier! I completed my projects.

Almost forgot to add...Today is all about practice so I'm really practicing. Let's see if I remember some commands:

git status is to check if there's anything new in my code 
git add . is to add a change
git commit -m "" is to commit my changes to git
git checkout -b branchname is to set up a new branch 
git checkout branchname is to switch branches

END!
